# Machine-Learning-CS229-
This repository contains solutions to the problem set from Stanford CS229 Machine Learning. I completed these problem sets by studying on my own with reference to:

(1) [Machine Learning: The Art and Science of Algorithms that Make Sense of Data](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Science-Algorithms-Sense/dp/1107422221)
(A nice book suggested by my master thesis supervisor).

(2) [Stanford CS229 Lecture Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)

I did these problem sets to consolidate knowledge I learnt from (1) as a preparation towards [real life project](https://github.com/lingminhao/Explainable-Machine-Learning-Classification-using-Wing-Venation-Data). 

In addition to these, I obtained the Machine Learning Certificate by Coursera.
