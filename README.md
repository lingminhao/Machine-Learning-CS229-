This repository contains solutions to the problem set from Stanford CS229 Machine Learning. I completed these problem sets by studying on my own with reference to:

(1) [Machine Learning: The Art and Science of Algorithms that Make Sense of Data](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Science-Algorithms-Sense/dp/1107422221)
(A nice book suggested by my master thesis supervisor).

(2) [Stanford CS229 Lecture Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)

I did these problem sets to consolidate knowledge I learnt from (1) as a preparation towards my [master project](https://github.com/lingminhao/Explainable-Machine-Learning-Classification-using-Wing-Venation-Data). 

In addition to these, I obtained the Stanford Machine Learning Specialization Certificate by Coursera. 
Here is the link to have a look to the [Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/98d3fe9ce9a32656d17f2f1aac277f24). ![Certificate](https://github.com/lingminhao/Machine-Learning-CS229-/blob/main/Certificate.png)
